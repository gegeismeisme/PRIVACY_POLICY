# Luna Window — Support

If you need help, contact us at: qq260316514@gmail.com

## Quick start

1. Open Luna Window.
2. Pick a Scene and Sound.
3. Tap **Enter Window** to start the full‑screen experience.
4. Tap the screen to show controls (Scenes, Sound, Timer, Settings).

## FAQ

### How do I unlock all scenes?

On the Home screen or in the Window controls, tap **Unlock** to purchase the one‑time unlock.

### How do I restore my purchase?

Open **Settings** → **Restore Purchases**.

### How do I import my own audio (white noise / music)?

Open **Settings** → **Import Audio…** and choose a file from the Files picker.

### Where is my data stored?

- Luna Window is designed to work offline.
- Preferences (selected scene, sound, timer, toggles) are stored locally on your device.
- Imported audio files are stored locally in the app sandbox and can be deleted in Settings.

### There is no sound. What should I check?

1. Turn up the iPhone/iPad volume.
2. In **Settings**, increase the in‑app volume slider.
3. If you use a sleep timer, check whether it already ended.
4. If you turned off background playback, audio may stop when leaving the app.

### How do I reduce power usage?

Enable **Battery Saver** in Settings to reduce animation intensity and refresh rate.
