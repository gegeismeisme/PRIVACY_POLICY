# Privacy Policy

## TL;DR
Snowveil is offline-only. It does not collect, sell, or share personal data.

## What we collect
- Nothing.

## What is stored on your device
Snowveil stores only what is needed to remember your preferences:
- Per-site settings (visual style and effect parameters) in `chrome.storage.local`.
- UI language preference in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Ambient audio settings in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Optional audio files you upload, stored locally in IndexedDB (inside the extension).

## Network / third parties
- Snowveil makes no external network requests and has no analytics.
- If you open a donate link, your browser will navigate to a third-party site; their policies apply.

## Permissions and why
- `storage`: save your settings locally.
- `offscreen`: keep one ambient audio track playing after the popup closes.
- Host access (http/https pages): required to render the overlay on pages you enable. Snowveil does not transmit page content.

## Data deletion
- Disable or remove the extension to stop all effects.
- Uninstalling the extension deletes its local storage (settings and uploaded audio) from your device.
