Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2016-02-09

HSK 3 Hanzi Cards ("we", "our", or "the app") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we process and how.

1) Scope
This policy applies to the Android app HSK 3 Hanzi Cards distributed on Google Play.

2) Data We Collect
We do not collect personal data from users in the current version.
The app stores learning progress data locally on your device, such as:
- review counts
- streak information
- daily target settings
- font scale and learning scope preferences
This local data is not uploaded to our servers in the current version.

3) Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.

4) Account and Login
The app does not require account registration or login in the current version.

5) Audio and TTS
The app uses Android system text-to-speech (TTS) for pronunciation playback. TTS behavior depends on device settings and installed voice packages.

6) Children’s Privacy
The app is designed for general language learners and is not primarily directed to children.

7) Data Retention and Deletion
Because progress data is stored locally, you can remove app data by:
- clearing app storage in Android settings, or
- uninstalling the app.

8) Security
We use a local-first architecture in the current version. No user account backend is used for progress sync.

9) Policy Updates
We may update this policy when app functionality changes. The effective date above will be updated accordingly.
