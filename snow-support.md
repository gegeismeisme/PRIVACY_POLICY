## Snowveil Support

If you need help, found a bug, or have a feature request:

- Email: `qq260316514@gmail.com`
- GitHub Issues: (recommended) open an issue in the project repository with steps to reproduce.

### Troubleshooting checklist

- Reload the page after installing/updating the extension (older open tabs may need a reload).
- Confirm the page is a normal `http/https` website (Chrome pages and the Chrome Web Store do not allow extensions).
- Try disabling other extensions that may also inject overlays/filters.

### What to include in a bug report

- Your Chrome version and OS.
- The website URL (if you can share it).
- Steps to reproduce + what you expected vs what happened.
- A screenshot/screen recording if possible.
